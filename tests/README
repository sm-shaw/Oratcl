There are test files in this directory.
These tests exercise the basic Oratcl
functions. See comments  in the individual files for 
more info.

The files containing ora in the file name test
Oratcl commands.

The files containing i18n in the filename test the
Oratcl commands with unicode strings. This tests
the internationalization features of Tcl8.1.

The entire test suite may be run from the source build
directory with

> make test



In addition, each test file may be sourced in the Tcl Interpreter.
If nothing is returned, then the test passed.

Example:

%source basic_tests.test
%
